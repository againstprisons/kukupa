<p>Hello,</p>

<p>
  Someone, hopefully you, requested a password reset
  for the account <%= e(email) %> on <%= e(site_name) %>.
</p>

<p>
  To reset the password for your account,
  <a href="<%= e(reset_url) %>">click here</a>,
  or copy and paste the following link into your browser:

  <blockquote>
    <%= e(reset_url) %>
  </blockquote>
</p>

<p>
  If you did not request this password reset, you can safely
  ignore this email. This password reset link will expire
  in 30 minutes.
</p>

<p>
  Thank you!
</p>
